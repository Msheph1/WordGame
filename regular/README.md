New word game that is a mix between crosswords and wordle
The user gets to select x letters they want to start with in a 5 by 5 grid full of words
then the user will go around and guess what they think each word will be and get a certain number of chances at guessing
after each guess the user will receive feedback based the letters they used for that row and column 
Gray = miss
Yellow = horizontal
Blue = veritcal
Yellow/Blue = both
Green = correct

a winning game would be the user solving all the words without making x mistakes








Added a new index2 to mess around with stuff probably going to need to put the input fields somewhere else and have then fill in the grid and fix tabs
Also should grab all words 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6, 7 that way we can have variable grid and work with black squares
Also have to decide if we want it to check word by word or board by board or board by board - incorrect letters
